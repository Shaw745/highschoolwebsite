            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Teaching at New Day College is interactive and student-centred.
              Lessons are carefully planned to blend explanation, discussion,
              practice, and reflection. Teachers use instructional materials,
              technology, real-life case studies, and hands-on activities to
              bring abstract concepts to life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              We encourage students to ask questions, think independently, and
              collaborate with their peers. Regular class presentations, group
              projects, and research assignments help develop communication,
              problem-solving, and leadership skills.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Our teachers also maintain close contact with parents and
              guardians through progress reports, open days, and scheduled
              meetings to ensure that each child receives the support they need
              both at school and at home.

                Every weekend, our students receive carefully selected reading
                tasks across different subjects and genres. On Mondays, they
                present and discuss what they have read with their classmates
                and teachers.

                public speaking. It also encourages them to read widely, think
                critically, and articulate their thoughts clearly in front of
                others.

                Our regular take-home assignments are more than routine
                homework. They are designed to help students apply theoretical
                concepts to real-life problems, keeping them engaged,
                challenged, and focused.

                Teachers deliberately structure these tasks to develop
                problem-solving skills, creativity, research habits, and a sense
                of responsibility. Parents are also given clear guidance on how
                to support their children’s learning without doing the work for
                them.
